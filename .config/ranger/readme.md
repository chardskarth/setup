# CSKTH Ranger config

This was copied from someone else's ranger config. I'll make sure to add him here when I got the chance (I don't have my macbook with me now and I'm just using my raspberry pi now. :(  )


# Known issues
- inline image preview is not turned on now. It's not working with my default terminal client, terminator
- when image preview is turned on, in `scope.sh` image/*) part, call to `identify` takes longer and causes my pi to hang
