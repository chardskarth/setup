# CSKTH Dotfiles
Here lies my linux dotfiles configuration. Use at your own risk!

# Installation
```
# DOTFILES_DIR must be sourced in bashrc.
# this is weird because you need to clone first
# so during installation, we'll have to do
DOTFILES_DIR=~/sources/chardskarth/cskth-dotfiles
mkdir -p $DOTFILES_DIR
git clone <this dotfile> $DOTFILES_DIR
```

# Features
- bashrc configuration
- awesomewm configuration
- nvim configuration
- ranger configuration (from some guy, I'll make sure to mention when I remember)
- zsh configuration & custom zsh scripts
- dmenu with patches
- various bashscripts
- other configuration files for:
	-	picom/compton
	- drun theme `rofi.rasi` (from titus)
-	obsolete sublime text configuration
- obsolete vim configuration

Some files here are reminders of my previous setup. You can ignore them
- autokey
- my ergodox cheatsheet
- sizeup
